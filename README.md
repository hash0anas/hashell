# hashell
A simple unix shell with some classic unix programs.

Everything is precompiled with gcc on an x86 architecture. To run the shell: `./hashell`

The programs are implemented just as a proof of concept. They don't offer any additional functionality to the classic built-in unix commands.

In case you're wondering, the name `hashell` is inspired from my last name, Hashim.
